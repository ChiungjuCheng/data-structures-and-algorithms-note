# Connectivity 
A graph is said to be connected if there is a path between every pair of vertex. From every vertex to any other vertex, there should be some path to traverse. That is called the connectivity of a graph. A graph with multiple disconnected vertices and edges is said to be disconnected.

# 有向圖的連通性
**Strong connectivity** 任兩點之間可以互相到達對方
 
# 在linear time判定Graph是否為strongly connected
TestSC (G)
1. pick any node s in G
2. R = BFS(s, G), R為BFS走過的node集合
3. Rrev = BFS(s, Grev), Grev : G內的edge反方向
4. if(R = V = Rrev) then return true else fale, V : G的nodes 

Time: O(m + n)

# 如何判斷圖中有多少個Strong components
**Strong component** 任意兩點間能夠互相到達對方，且是最大的集合，表示當加入圖的其他點時會使得其不再為Strong component
